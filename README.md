# php_intro_assessment

In this programming assignment you will be practicing PHP values, variables, and built in functions.

Your finished product should be a link to a GitHub repository.

To complete the activity, you will need to do the following:

Declare three variables firstName, lastName, and age
Assign the firstName variable a string value of your first name
Assign the lastName variable a string value of your last name
Assign the age variable a number value of your age (if you're self conscious about that like I am, feel free to put a fake age)
Echo the words "My name is [FULL NAME HERE]" using the values from your firstName and lastName variables
Echo the words "I am [AGE HERE] years old" using the value from your age variable
